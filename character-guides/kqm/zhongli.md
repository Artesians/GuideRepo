## **Preface**

Zhongli's rise to power since his buffs in 1.3 has left many Genshin Impact players wishing that they had pulled on his banner. Between a global RES shred and stronger shield, the Geo Archon has rocketed in value since his troubled release.

### **Support**

At level 70, a +20 flower, and talent level 6 in Dominus Lapidis, Zhongli is casting a 4,820 health shield with 150% damage absorption. His damage is pretty weak for shield-bot gameplay, but his utility and the comfort that he offers cannot be understated as you approach the endgame.

* **Pros:**
  * Strong Jade Shield that provides stagger resistance and elemental and physical shred.
  * Extremely flexible for players that clear DPS checks with three characters.
  * Makes the game comfortable to play with Jade Shield's one stop shop utility.
  * Planet Befall has extremely long invulnerability frames.
  * RES shred for a potential 20 seconds can offer \(less\) increased damage for less work than Viridescent Venerer.
  * In Geo quickswap teams, his resonance damage off his Stone Steele is impressive.
* **Cons:**
  * His petrify is fairly short, but it buys breathing time.
  * Using his Planet Befall takes a long time to cast and typically is a DPS loss in the later portions of the game.

### **Physical Carry**

Physical carry Zhongli can make use of his global shred and abuse his fast auto attacks with Crescent Pike to push his physical damage further. With his buffs in 1.3, he has more room to deviate from Crescent Pike and can consider using Primordial Jade-Winged Spear or the Staff of Homa. 

* **Pros:**
  * R3 Crescent Pike is easily achievable, as the game rewards three northlander polearm prototypes.
  * Zhongli is completely self sufficient as a DPS unit, leaving a lot of freedom for his team compositions.
  * Zhongli can empower his supports while on field with Crescent Pike to push the total team damage further.
  * Extremely safe as a DPS unit because of his shield and petrify.
  * His resistance shred still supports his team just as much as his support builds.
* **Cons:**
  * The ceiling on Zhongli's physical damage output is not that high compared to the hypercarries in the game, but is more than capable of reaching equivalent or higher total team damage output against viable carries like Razor or Keqing.

## **Talent Priority**

### Support

Planet Befall &gt; Dominus Lapidis &gt; Normal Attack: Rain of Stone

Planet Befall has the highest talent scaling of any single ability in the game and ramps up quite sharply every talent upgrade \(65% per talent level\) and the petrified status gets longer. Dominus Lapidis gets power from going beyond talent level 6, but the effects may not be as noticeable as dropping his Burst.

### Physical Carry

Normal Attack: Rain of Stone &gt; Planet Befall &gt; Dominus Lapidis

Simple, enough, Rain of Stone will provide your higher talent values per second on your autos. Planet Befall gets more petrification time and damage.



## **Constellations**

#### **C1: Rock, the Backbone of Earth**

_Increase the maximum amount of Stone Steles created by Dominus Lapidis that may exist simultaneously to 2._

Increases the area of AoE when used in tandem with the Geo MC's burst constructs. It's an indirect buff to his energy recharge.

#### **C2: Stone, the Cradle of Jade**

_Planet Befall grants nearby characters on the field a Jade Shield when it descends._

P

#### **C4: Topaz, Unbreakable and Fearless**

_Increases Planet Befall’s AoE by 20% and increases the duration of Petrification by 2 seconds._

I assume you’re here because C6.

**C5: Lazuli, Herald of the Order**

Increases the Level of Planet Befall by 3.

#### **C6: Chrysos, Bounty of Dominator**

_When Jade Shield takes DMG, 40% of that incoming DMG is converted to HP for the current on-field character. A single instance of the regeneration cannot exceed 8% of the character’s Max HP._

This constellation is not whalebait. It’s the real deal, Xiao’s C6 is outperforming melt-Ganyu by a juicy 3.4%.

## **Team Compositions**

Since he's energy hungry with a 70 energy cost for his burst, he mostly needs an Anemo battery. With high energy recharge builds, Xiao compositions open up to compositions that are a little more “energy dense,” for example with Fischl and Xingqiu. In general however, Xiao compositions are not too flexible with Anemo batteries. You have room for 2 units that have to offer one of the following good off-field damage, heal, or give Xiao a damage buff. Since his burst burns a percentage of his max health, weaker Xiao’s suffer from it more so than hyper invested Xiao’s.

### **Anemo Batteries**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/3%20%281%29.png)

**Sucrose:** **\(115-120+ ER\)**

Offering the strongest option for Anemo particles, you can cast her E up to 3 times with Sacrificial Fragments and C1, but optimally, you cast it twice and immediately switch to Xiao for the on-field particles. Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers is another good weapon, it buffs Xiao’s ATK by 48% for 10s, but the buff is quite short with relatively high downtime.

**Venti: \(130+ ER\)**

You use him as DPS while Xiao is out of his burst because Xiao cannot plunge enemies inside Venti’s Q. Your optimal rotation can be quite awkward to manage because of the constraints he puts on your team. 8 seconds is a longer amount of time than you think.

**Jean: \(140+ ER\)**

Jean condenses as a healer and an Anemo battery. Her 6 second cooldown is very appreciated when your rotations come apart, and her battery capabilities improve with a Favonius Sword.

**Anemo MC: \(150+ ER\)**

Shreds Anemo RES with Q for 10 seconds post-AR46 and also works better with a Favonius Sword.

Battery energy recharge thresholds are hard to define because of HP threshold orbs. Testing Xiao on the current abyss floor 12 is obscenely skewed especially when compared to single enemy fights like the Primo Geovishap. **For low investment Xiao, aim for 160+ energy recharge**, while hyper invested Xiao’s can scrape by with 120% or lower depending on the enemy density.

### **Healers**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/4%20%281%29.png)

Xiao prefers quick bursts of healing or healing over time that can be done off-field. Using Diona and Bennett might seem powerful, but realistically, Xiao isn’t really on field and in a single place for a very long time. This pushes the value of Barbara, Jean, Qiqi, and Xingqiu a little higher. All supports have the ability to run Favonius weapons that can generate neutral particles for Xiao.

**Qiqi:**  
Very strong heals and her E uptime is pretty close to Xiao’s burst uptime, but she literally does nothing else and generates 0 particles.

**Bennett:**  
His healing takes Xiao up to 70% of his max health, so you’re bouncing around 40-70% of Xiao’s health if you can maintain high uptime on Bennett who would also require a boatload of ER. The major problem is that Xiao’s plunge spams push small enemies out and chasing them hurts the healing, not to mention the ATK buff, but perhaps the greater issue is that you end up killing enemies extremely quickly so that you end up chasing enemies anyways. Trying to reposition to bounce enemies inside hurts his dps uptime A LOT because you don’t want to use his E mid ult.

**Diona:**  
Pretty good zone healing like Bennett, suffers from the same problems. The upside is that Sacrificial Bow Diona generates an insane amount of Cryo particles. The shield max duration is capped at lv7 Icy Paws, with hold E the shield has 12 seconds of shield up time, 15s CD if no sac bow passive proc. And her shield in full HP build \(shielder build\) is quite large.

**Jean:**  
Burst healer and Anemo. Might not be enough particles, but that just means you need more energy recharge because running triple Anemo is atrocious.

**Barbara:**  
Access to off-field healing and a burst heal make her pretty valuable. She’s a catalyst user so she can also run Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers to help Xiao’s ATK% deficit, but the uptime on the buff is iffy, just like her energy particle generation.

**Xingqiu:**  
Actually one of the stronger options to use with Xiao with the caveat being that Xingqiu needs to be really well invested in order to heal Xiao enough. His presence also forces you to use normal attack cancels with plunges or combo with normals. Also offers stagger resistance and damage reduction.

### **Buffers**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5%20%281%29.png)

**Zhongli:**  
The best in slot by providing Xiao a beefy shield that also shreds Anemo RES and anything that Xiao is swirling. You would have had to have pulled Zhongli while he was significantly weaker.

**Anemo MC:**  
At AR46 you gain access to a constellation that can also shred Anemo RES after Q casts. The only mechanic to note is that casting the Anemo MC Q on any kind of obstruction \(ice cages or Zhongli pillar for example\) will allow the Q to stop moving.

**Bennett:**  
An invaluable unit that provides healing as well as a massive ATK bonus that can make up for the lost ATK% on lower invested Xiao’s, but in practice, it's really easy to knock away small enemies out of the circle.

**Lisa:**  
Charlie and some others have proposed using Lisa A4 for the DEF down area effect. It runs into the same problem as Bennett and Diona because of the zone, but the buff is undoubtedly powerful. Another issue is that providing Lisa with enough energy is more difficult than battery for Xiao. 4TS Xiao is a possibility.

### **Sub-DPS**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/6%20%281%29.png)

**Ganyu:**  
I’m not really sure why you’re here to ask me if Ganyu can be used as a support, when she’s the best DPS option in the game, but sure: it works. Just cast your Q and E and go off, her raw damage over 15 seconds if nothing else makes it viable.,

**Fischl:**  
Very strong with Xiao and generates a lot of passive orbs on field while Xiao is out.

**Albedo:**  
Albedo has some of the strongest AoE sub DPS capabilities in the game, and Xiao can attack at a high frequency. Their power as a duo is very strong against large groups of enemies, and Albedo drops small shields for what it’s worth.

**Tartaglia:**  
Offers +1 to your Auto Attack: Whirlwind Thrust and has a low energy cost for his burst. Quick in and out.

**Xingqiu, Beidou, Lisa:**  
Very strong choices at high values of energy recharge. Their only limitation is that the number of orbs that are being generated are fairly low in the composition and are typically funneled into Xiao.

## **How To Play Zhongli**

Xiao is not a simple character. By merit of how his burst works and its energy costs, Xiao has to play as an extremely greedy main DPS. There are several important things that have to be fulfilled while playing him:

* While in elemental burst, you cannot cast your Lemniscatic Wind Cycling at all without losing the energy that it would provide later.
* While off field, your rotations have to be optimized to keep high uptime on any buffs that would be transferred to him.
* Generated Anemo particles should be picked up by Xiao himself.
* High plunges should be utilized almost at all times.
* **If your Xiao is not at talent level 10 with extremely well rolled artifacts, it is recommended that you use an energy recharge timepiece,** Xiao has extreme energy problems at lower energy thresholds if he cannot clear abyss/content within two casts of Bane of All Evil. Recharging his 3rd Q cast is very, very painful. Test your Xiao on Floor 12 and against the Primo Geovishap if you want an idea of how your ER should be.

Xiao’s kit allows him to string many of his attacks together, but very few are efficient and provide good damage without compromising his energy.

[**N1CJP - “Jet Combo”**](https://imgur.com/a/9dMEntj)

N1CJP is an abbreviated form of Normal Attack 1, Charged Attack, Jump, High Plunge. It is a combo that cancels the animation for Xiao's charged attack and allows Xiao to plunge enemies that he has knocked up. Currently, it is his highest MV/s combo while he is inside his burst.

To do it, just hold down LMB for your Charged Attack, then jump after Xiao swings upward with his spear, then plunge after he passes the upper part of the rake from his Charged Attack.

**High Plunge Spam**

High plunge spam is exactly as it sounds, you jump up [high enough](https://imgur.com/fuC3rSh) for a high plunge and cancel the recovery frame by holding down a movement key or attacking once with a normal attack. This is more efficient than low plunge spam as long as you don’t go to the peak of your jump.

[**JEP Combo**](https://imgur.com/BYOY4p6) 

This combo can be used if you need to gap close with its high mobility and high damage for the time it takes to do. You just jump, use Lemniscatic Wind Cycling, and plunge. However, you should only use this outside of your burst and when you are certain you can hit the enemy for Anemo particles.
