## **Preface**

Zhongli's rise to power since his buffs in 1.3 has left many Genshin Impact players wishing that they had pulled on his banner. Between a global RES shred and stronger shield, the Geo Archon has rocketed in value since his troubled release.

### **Support**

At level 70, a +20 flower, and talent level 6 in Dominus Lapidis, Zhongli is casting a 4,820 health shield with 150% damage absorption. His damage is pretty weak for shield-bot gameplay, but his utility and the comfort that he offers cannot be understated as you approach the endgame.

* **Pros:**
  * Strong Jade Shield that provides stagger resistance and elemental and physical shred.
  * Extremely flexible for players that clear DPS checks with three characters.
  * Makes the game comfortable to play with Jade Shield's one stop shop utility.
  * Planet Befall has extremely long invulnerability frames.
  * RES shred for a potential 20 seconds can offer \(less\) increased damage for less work than Viridescent Venerer.
  * In Geo quickswap teams, his resonance damage off his Stone Steele is impressive.
* **Cons:**
  * His petrify is fairly short, but it buys breathing time.
  * Using his Planet Befall takes a long time to cast and typically is a DPS loss in the later portions of the game.

### **Physical Carry**

Physical carry Zhongli can make use of his global shred and abuse his fast auto attacks with Crescent Pike to push his physical damage further. With his buffs in 1.3, he has more room to deviate from Crescent Pike and can consider using Primordial Jade-Winged Spear or the Staff of Homa. 

* **Pros:**
  * R3 Crescent Pike is easily achievable, as the game rewards three northlander polearm prototypes.
  * Zhongli is completely self sufficient as a DPS unit, leaving a lot of freedom for his team compositions.
  * Zhongli can empower his supports while on field with Crescent Pike to push the total team damage further.
  * Extremely safe as a DPS unit because of his shield and petrify.
  * His resistance shred still supports his team just as much as his support builds.
* **Cons:**
  * The ceiling on Zhongli's physical damage output is not that high compared to the hypercarries in the game, but is more than capable of reaching equivalent or higher total team damage output against viable carries like Razor or Keqing.

## **Talent Priority**

### Support

Planet Befall &gt; Dominus Lapidis &gt; Normal Attack: Rain of Stone

Planet Befall has the highest talent scaling of any single ability in the game and ramps up quite sharply every talent upgrade \(65% per talent level\) and the petrified status gets longer. Dominus Lapidis gets power from going beyond talent level 6, but the effects may not be as noticeable as dropping his Burst.

### Physical Carry

Normal Attack: Rain of Stone &gt; Planet Befall &gt; Dominus Lapidis

Simple, enough, Rain of Stone will provide your higher talent values per second on your autos. Planet Befall gets more petrification time and damage.



## **Constellations**

#### **C1: Rock, the Backbone of Earth**

_Increase the maximum amount of Stone Steles created by Dominus Lapidis that may exist simultaneously to 2._

Increases the area of AoE when used in tandem with the Geo MC's burst constructs. It's an indirect buff to his energy recharge.

#### **C2: Stone, the Cradle of Jade**

_Planet Befall grants nearby characters on the field a Jade Shield when it descends._

Offers immense utility for support Zhongli builds, making refreshing his shield and using his burst cost half the time. Stone Steele repositioning is significantly easier. Also works in co-op.

#### **C4: Topaz, Unbreakable and Fearless**

_Increases Planet Befall’s AoE by 20% and increases the duration of Petrification by 2 seconds._

Significant utility boon for his Planet Befall.

**C5: Lazuli, Herald of the Order**

_Increases the level of Planet Befall by 3._

An additional 195% talent scaling is nothing to scoff at and leaves you at a potential 1034% talent percent at level 13.

#### **C6: Chrysos, Bounty of Dominator**

_When Jade Shield takes DMG, 40% of that incoming DMG is converted to HP for the current on-field character. A single instance of the regeneration cannot exceed 8% of the character’s Max HP._

This constellation has become a double edged sword for Zhongli with the release of the Staff of Homa and Hu Tao. Its value is now dependent on team composition and weapon choice.

## **How To Play Zhongli**

### Support

Zhongli as a support is not a particularly cerebral character to play. You swap to him to refresh his Jade Shield and drop Planet Befall and swap back. Occasionally you can use his E to reposition, but at lower investments and without other Geo constructs, it might not be worth it.

As for team compositions, his value extends far and wide. With stagger resistance, universal resistance shred, and a strong shield that can last for 20 seconds, its very clear to see his strength as a support. For particular synergies, he works very well with Ganyu and Xiao to shred resistances and offer them the stagger resistance they so direly appreciate. He fits universally in nearly every type of composition as long as you can keep his Stone Steele from reducing elemental gauges and his resistance shred is weaker than Viridescent Venerer for mono-element compositions.

### **Physical Carry**

For physical Zhongli, his combos for proper damage output changes on your choice of weaponry. For Crescent Pike users, optimal damage is using N4 cancels by sprinting after the spear kick. It is recommended to use Superconduct with Fischl and Geo resonance to push his damage profile further. For 5\* weapons, N4 spear kicks into a Charged Attack yield strong results.

#### \*\*\*\*

| Composition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/unknown-7-.png) | Zhongli DPS with Geo resonance while strong sub-DPS's are empowered by his Jade Shield resistance shred. |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/zhong_2geo_2pyro.jpg) | "Microwave" composition that allows you to play around his resonance with GeoMC. You can replace Bennett with Fischl for significantly more energy to play quickswap. |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/zhong_2geo_sc.jpg) | A fairly standard composition with Superconduct Fischl echoes and Geo resonance. |
