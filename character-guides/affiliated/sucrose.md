* Official Genshin Website

**Rarity: 4-Star  
Element: Anemo  
Weapon Type: Catalyst**

## **1. Introduction**

Sucrose is a 4-star anemo catalyst user that is capable of amazing elemental mastery passover, Good elemental skill/burst anemo damage and decent Crowd Control \(CC\).

Whether as a DPS-role or a EM-support role, Sucrose’s abilities shine brightest when your team composition is able to bring forth element applications and cause copious amounts of reaction damage. Not to mention having 2-charge elemental aoe skill \(at Constellation 1\) and DoT aoe burst will always keep multiple light/mid-weighted enemies in a crowd for your other teammates to secure a solid swipe.

However, as an anemo-catalyst user, Sucrose will suffer against enemies who have anemo status or immunity to their own element, meaning slimes will be very tough to strike down without a proper team composition. In addition, her full potential only shines greatly when her constellation-1, -4 is achieved and her constellation-6 skill leaves much to be desired.

## **2. Skills**

### **Normal/Charged Attack: Wind Spirit Creation**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28130%29.png)

Sucrose’s basic attack. Compared to other catalyst users, Sucrose’s **normal attack base dmg is low**. It is a 4-hit combo with decent speed. Not recommended for use unless out of stamina or activating con-4 skill.

Her charge attack however, is fairly strong with decent range. **It’s a good alternative damage source when elemental skill/burst is on CD**. It should also be noted that Normal and Charge attacks have separate ICD, meaning mixing up the attacks will be a huge benefit with reactions.

### **Elemental Skill: Astable Anemohypostasis Creation - 6308**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28131%29.png)

Sucrose’s elemental skill. **Main source of DPS** regardless of role. Unlike most of the cast, **Sucrose gets 2 charges for her skill at constellation 1**. It is an **AoE attack that can pull and launch, giving small CC properties**. It can bring objects into the sphere including Klee’s little bombs.

### **Elemental Burst: Forbidden Creation - Isomer 75 / Type II**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28136%29.png)

Sucrose throws a projectile which bursts into a giant crystal fly that can **pull and launch enemies periodically for a certain time**. It will deal anemo damage per dmg. Sucrose’s burst can also absorb ONE element and will deal additional elemental damage of the type absorbed.

### **Passive Talent 1: Catalyst Conversion**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28135%29.png)

When Sucrose triggers a swirl effect with a certain element, characters with a matching element \(excluding Sucrose\) will **gain 50 Elemental Mastery for 8 seconds**. You can apply this talent for multiple elements at the same time and the CD will reset every time you create a swirl reaction. While not a lot of EM transfer, every little bit counts.

### **Passive Talent 2: Mollis Favonius**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28134%29.png)

When Sucrose hits an opponent with **either Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst**, all party members \(excluding Sucrose\) will gain 20% of Sucrose’s EM for 8s. Once again, CD will reset every time the skill/burst is applied.

### **Overworld Talent: Astable Invention**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28132%29.png)

Quite underrated. When Sucrose crafts character/weapon ascension materials at the crafting bench, she has **10% chance of doubling her product.**

## **3. Constellations**

### 1. Clustered Vacuum Field

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Sucrose’s elemental skill gains **1 additional charge**. This is one of the two best constellations Sucrose can get. 10/10 in value. If you are able to get an extra constellation for Sucrose at c0, it is very recommended.

### 2. Beth Unbound Form

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

Sucrose’s elemental burst gains **2 additional seconds of duration.** It’s not much but it helps when it counts.

### 3. Flawless Alchemistress

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

Increases **Sucrose’s elemental skill talent lvl by 3**. Considering this is one of her best DPS sources as well as passive trigger, this helps Sucrose immensely.

### 4. Alchemania

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

The constellation which unlocks Sucrose’s full potential. **Every 7th normal/charge attack, Sucrose’s elemental skill CD will get reduced by 1~7s.** This makes her double charge elemental skill even more available with constant reduced cooldown. Makes her DPS role even more viable.

### 5. Caution: Standard Flask

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

Increase **Sucrose’s burst talent level by 3.** Once again, Sucrose’s elemental burst is a good source of dmg and CC. This helps Sucrose immensely.

### 6. Chaotic Entropy

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)

**When Sucrose’s burst absorbs an element. Characters with matching element will gain 20% elemental damage bonus.** While on paper it sounds good, the practical application is tough as an undesirable elemental absorption can occur outside of the player’s control. It is left much to be desired.

## 4. Weapon Choice

Sucrose’s choice of weapons will depend greatly on what role she will be fulfilling. Here are some very good weapons from our list \(unordered\). For ease of identification, we have separated the EM based and DPS based catalyst in separate tables for you.

Having a chance to gain a charge of elemental skill back secretly gives Sucrose 3 elemental skills. In addition, the EM substat only solidifies her role into giving a good deal of EM towards the team.** |

Still it is worth using as a 3-star since the max EM value exceeds that of Mappa Mare.** |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="DPS Catalysts" %}
| **Name** | **Description** |

| ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/L3saDPCs6vXIFAn5nZPCTrWLWp-exwJA_Zkuf-VBsgmTVMk2XH9avWTEKRlw512s66-fwQoFHdttraCbhuG-pWlMUtF5XMXqLlij2oRYFbhFuVrfN05t4NpQ4PAhANrEEzNAeOOw)**Sacrificial Fragment** | **Despite being the best weapon for Sucrose EM build, giving Sucrose an extra E for her DPS is very solid. In addition, the EM substat works in harmony with reaction DPS and extra E skill charge leaves more opportunities to charge her burst. This weapon is just very good all around** |

Its passive also gives a good boost to her overall DMG** |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## 5. Artifact Set

Sucrose generally benefits a lot from sets that give her **EM, ER and Anemo bonus**. **Towards the endgame you should aim for only EM if you’re an EM support, or ATK/ANEMO/Crit\(or ATK if you are not using a crit based build\) if you are a DPS. Alternatively you can go EM/ANEMO/\(EM/ATK\) for a hybrid build, it shows that Sucrose is very flexible with what build she wants to do.** But there are definitely more favorable options for her. Here are some good ideas to get through.

## 6. Extra Features

There are multiple concerns and interesting factoids about Sucrose that players should know. These few pointers will help out future players to utilize Sucrose’s kit much better and get a flexible team comp. This section will get updated as time goes

### A. Elemental Mastery Stack

In addition to Sucrose’s passive talents sending Elemental Mastery to her team, **any other EM Sucrose gains can also be passed down to the team.** These EM increase Sucrose can gain can be things such as: Albedo’s Passive Talent 2 and Diona’s con-6 skill.

Overall EM a team member can gain once everything is stacked can be followed by this equation:

> **50 + \[\(&lt;Sucrose EM&gt; + &lt;Additional Party EM Buffs&gt;\)×0.2\] + &lt;Additional EM Buffs&gt;**

Also remember that EM gains are order based and value locked upon use. For example, if Sucrose receives the EM buff from Albedo after she has already passed down the EM, the additional party EM buffs will not be applied to the equation.

### B. Absorption

Sucrose’s elemental burst can absorb one element and pulses the same elemental DMG along with swirl. However, what can be really absorbed follows several rules **\(WARNING: we do not know the full detail of the absorption rule so we would like to ask your patience while we understand it further\):**

* **Enemies’ or Player’s inflicted element will be absorbed.**
* **Environment can be absorbed \(ex. if there is water nearby, the burst will absorb its hydro element\)**
* **Certain characters infusing themselves with an element can be absorbed \(not weapons, so Chongyun and Keqing won’t work\)**

Non-crystallized element shields \(Xinyan and Diona\) can also apply elements to the burst. For consistency, you can create the shield, then **Switch to another character so the element refreshes.**

### **C. Gravity**

Sucrose’s elemental skill has a property that gravitates enemies and items towards the center of the AoE. This usually stops there until there has been a revelation that a falling enemy from heights can be gravitated to the ground at a faster rate with a little bit of help from Sucrose elemental skill.

Such concept has been found with characters that are able to lift enemies up very high. Jean + Sucrose combination is a perfect example in which Jean can lift enemies up hard from the charge attack and elemental skill then use Sucrose elemental skill gravity to make them hit the ground with high fall dmg.

## **7. Recommended Team Compositions**

Compositions that benefit from large amounts of elemental mastery or frequent swirl reactions will be the best fit for sucrose, however as discussed above she is a very versatile character who can fit into a great many teams. The most popular and effective are listed below.

### Taser: Sucrose/Xingqiu/Fischl/Beidou

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7RmyxYIzDurSmb76T7gWOvJH62saFTtnmw3JSdp-mv9eIGf1KXkdLMAfeGBq6dcF5BD9QQwkT4wvkq3K-2gAYSvVZuaVYpwBYsJJLgBSZwEP1LlYmqw9A5eMElWZpJSGtXFIpZoc)

Making extensive use of Sucrose’s separate elemental application cooldowns \(from her skill, basic attacks, and charged attacks\), the taser comp uses her as a main DPS to constantly swirl electrocharged reactions. Uniquely, sucrose takes the majority of on-field time as opposed to other teams.

Having EM-filled Sucrose in a maximum element reaction DPS team only makes burst damage fill even bigger. Various team comps that rely heavily on such reaction damage requires Sucrose to trigger her passives according to the element you will trigger the reaction with

### Mona Oneshot Clickbait:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/monaoneshotcomp.png)

A team built entirely around amplifying a vaporize reaction from Childe as much as possible, capable of clearing the first abyss 12 floors in one shot. Often drawing in many views and new players with its impressive final damage number, all of the effectiveness of this team comes from very carefully setting up buffs for a well planned reaction, making it difficult to play and relatively inflexible.
