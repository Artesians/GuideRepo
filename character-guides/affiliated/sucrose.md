**Rarity: 4-Star  
Element: Anemo  
Weapon Type: Catalyst**

## **1. Introduction**

Sucrose is a 4-star anemo catalyst user that is capable of amazing elemental mastery passover, Good elemental skill/burst anemo damage and decent Crowd Control \(CC\).

Whether as a DPS-role or a EM-support role, Sucrose’s abilities shine brightest when your team composition is able to bring forth element applications and cause copious amounts of reaction damage. Not to mention having 2-charge elemental aoe skill \(at Constellation 1\) and DoT aoe burst will always keep multiple light/mid-weighted enemies in a crowd for your other teammates to secure a solid swipe.

However, as an anemo-catalyst user, Sucrose will suffer against enemies who have anemo status or immunity to their own element, meaning slimes will be very tough to strike down without a proper team composition. In addition, her full potential only shines greatly when her constellation-1, -4 is achieved and her constellation-6 skill leaves much to be desired.

## **2. Skills**

### **Normal/Charged Attack: Wind Spirit Creation**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28130%29.png)

Sucrose’s basic attack. Compared to other catalyst users, Sucrose’s **normal attack base dmg is low**. It is a 4-hit combo with decent speed. Not recommended for use unless out of stamina or activating con-4 skill.

Her charge attack however, is fairly strong with decent range. **It’s a good alternative damage source when elemental skill/burst is on CD**. It should also be noted that Normal and Charge attacks have separate ICD, meaning mixing up the attacks will be a huge benefit with reactions.

### **Elemental Skill: Astable Anemohypostasis Creation - 6308**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28131%29.png)

Sucrose’s elemental skill. **Main source of DPS** regardless of role. Unlike most of the cast, **Sucrose gets 2 charges for her skill at constellation 1**. It is an **AoE attack that can pull and launch, giving small CC properties**. It can bring objects into the sphere including Klee’s little bombs.

### **Elemental Burst: Forbidden Creation - Isomer 75 / Type II**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28136%29.png)

Sucrose throws a projectile which bursts into a giant crystal fly that can **pull and launch enemies periodically for a certain time**. It will deal anemo damage per dmg. Sucrose’s burst can also absorb ONE element and will deal additional elemental damage of the type absorbed.

### **Passive Talent 1: Catalyst Conversion**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28135%29.png)

When Sucrose triggers a swirl effect with a certain element, characters with a matching element \(excluding Sucrose\) will **gain 50 Elemental Mastery for 8 seconds**. You can apply this talent for multiple elements at the same time and the CD will reset every time you create a swirl reaction. While not a lot of EM transfer, every little bit counts.

### **Passive Talent 2: Mollis Favonius**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28134%29.png)

When Sucrose hits an opponent with **either Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst**, all party members \(excluding Sucrose\) will gain 20% of Sucrose’s EM for 8s. Once again, CD will reset every time the skill/burst is applied.

### **Overworld Talent: Astable Invention**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28132%29.png)

Quite underrated. When Sucrose crafts character/weapon ascension materials at the crafting bench, she has **10% chance of doubling her product.**
