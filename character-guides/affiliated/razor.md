## **1. Character Introduction**

![Source: https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/646899933969908794/](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8gvmj7WFmGLdfGSXPaXFhhroxqlikfR2vTvpV9zb28nSxPbgDaSPGeXBBlgVkbocSf3dv2LmZj7PyYLHvc43M_QcP6zd7ekp_6O8YS_W5gfy8lMMAWfmkDpvFf7c400N3iL3bHFW)

“Some say he is an orphan raised by wolves. Others say he is a wolf spirit in human form. He is most at home in the wild, fighting with claw and thunder. To this day the wolf boy can be found prowling the forest, where he and his wolf pack hunt to survive using nothing more than their animal instincts.”

Razor is a 4 star Main DPS character capable of dealing massive damage over time with his hard-hitting claymore and long-lasting ultimate ability. While he is selfish in that he prefers off-field supports and maximized field time due to the nature of his ult, his consistent damage output is among the best in the game.

**But why should I read this guide? Isn’t Razor an easy character to play?**

While at a glance his skills may look fairly straightforward, there are a lot of nuances in Razor’s kit. For example, when to tap E or hold E, what rotation to perform in different scenarios, how hitlag interacts with ult, how to maximize energy regen, and perhaps most importantly, how to make the most of other character’s abilities while piloting a selfish DPS. Knowledge and mastery of Razor’s kit and of his interactions with others will enable one to use Razor to his fullest potential at all stages of the game.

In addition, Razor’s optimal playstyle varies at different investment levels. While his ascension stat \(Phys DMG bonus\) greatly benefits his normal attacks and his Electro element makes him one of the best users of Superconduct, higher talents and constellation levels dramatically increase the potency of his Electro damage output. As a result, a maxed out Razor with sufficient support will become a powerhouse of a hybrid damage dealer with virtually no hard counters.

**So what does this guide cover?** 

This guide will help you make decisions on how to build your Razor, maximize his damage through proper usage of skills, and select the right teammates for every situation. We will mostly discuss Razor as a Physical Carry, as this is by far his most popular and accessible build and allows him to be a solid Main DPS for F2P and low-spenders. For people interested in the potential of a high investment Razor, we also discuss how to maximize his endgame damage with various teamcomp demonstrations. Testing for Hybrid and Electro Razor are still underway and more information will be added whenever appropriate.

### **Pros and Cons**

#### **Pros**

1. Fast attacks in Elemental Burst negates the claymore’s key weaknesses of being slow and allows him to apply massive hitlag, making Burst achieve close to 100% uptime when always hitting enemies \(hitlag extends effective duration of Burst\)
2. High energy recharge from passive and skill, allowing him to self-fund his Burst \(can even charge Burst out of combat by consuming Electro Sigils with hold E\)
3. Can apply On-Hit Electro in Burst for constant reactions \(e.g. Electro-Charged\)
4. Burst does not grant Electro Infusion but adds additional Electro DMG \(no hard elemental counters\) and grants high Electro RES \(80%\) making him a good counter to Electro enemies despite same element disadvantage
5. Burst grants resistance to interruption, Electro-Charged immunity \(great against Electro/Hydro slimes\) and self-cleanse which is useful against leyline disorders
6. Can hit certain aerial enemies with Hold E \(useful against Oceanid, Eye of the Storm, Ruin Hunters, Pyro/Cryo Regisvine weak points, etc.\)
7. Strong against humanoid enemies prevalent lategame \(e.g. Fatui, Electro Cicin and Pyro Agent\) due to their -20% Phys RES attribute
8. Flexible with support elements since damage isn’t reliant on Melt/Vaporize, only Superconduct which can be achieved with one Cryo character
9. Third passive grants a useful combat buff \(20% sprinting stamina reduction\)
10. Claymore can break Geo shields and Hold E is very effective against Cryo shields \(semi-effective against other elemental shields\)

#### **Cons**

1. Burst does not persist through character switches, forcing a selfish Main DPS playstyle and making him generally unsuitable for quickswap teamcomps
2. Typically requires strong off field supports to improve overall team damage
3. Reliance on Physical DMG at lower investments making him weak against Ruin Guards and high Phys RES enemies
4. Electro element has no access to amplifying reactions such as Melt and Vaporize which are available to Pyro, Cryo and Hydro DPSs
5. Overload \(Electro + Pyro\) is particularly inconvenient as it causes knockback of smaller enemies, making Pyro supports situationally unsuitable
6. Is close-ranged and must be near enemies to deal damage at all times
7. Cannot deal high burst damage without significant investment \(esp. if focusing on Phys\)
8. Does not generate particles during Burst with E as part of the selfish DPS design
9. Most power budget is in his Burst, hence is reliant on high Burst uptime which can be an issue against tanky bosses \(without Electro Resonance\)
10. Pre C4, tap E is a general DPS loss compared to AA spam but needs to be used to improve Burst uptime \(without Electro Resonance\)

## **3. Talents Overview**

### **Normal/Auto Attack \(AA\): Steel Fang**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8hfXl-USPFZyg4wWBU9f70j5aBV4iquZiZgaM3md0__xRzIM9q-MPTL41LiY9iXdkGbTIsDKQSxy57FoVxXJA6gnRU3KCA57alB9zNsdhrXySYO2R5WFwioLIw0f_Fm9c7aBq2_v)

Razor swings his claymore in a right slash, uppercut, and left slash, before slamming it on the ground. The 4th hit triggers knockback, so chaining only the first three prevents launching enemies. His charged attack is a continuous spinning attack that limits his movement and ends with a final swing that deals more damage and knockback. 

* 3 hit vs 4 hit \(normal\) - With dash cancelling, Razor’s 3 hit combo does more DPS than his 4 hit combo and prevents knockback.
* 3 hit vs 4 hit \(with Q\) - Razor does more DPS with the 4 hit combo, again using dash to cancel the recovery period.

### **Elemental Skill \(E\): Claw and Thunder**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_5DSNN8DxRdvoPYSNcHR74kMnIoXZHdAPmeXOzuebVZNUsHMSR9ul85q-JvcpcPqn78Z8EkmYCpCJOJu0vPeUQWFsysZ5Wej6dOrma5gDVexXYjpmb-1mbzSj5HRbl30LpqDuC9u)

**E \(tap\)**: Razor lunges forward and slams down with a large claw that deals AoE Electro damage. On hit, generates 3 particles and grants Razor an Electro Sigil \(up to a max of 3\), which increases Razor's ER by an additive 20% per Sigil. Each Sigil has a duration of 18 seconds, which refreshes whenever E is tapped. 6 second cooldown.

**E \(hold\)**: After a small delay, Razor slams his hand down, dealing Electro damage in a wide circle around him and absorbing any active Sigils for 5 energy each. On hit, generates 4 particles. 10 second cooldown.

* E \(tap\) vs E \(hold\): Tap is better for DPS post-C4, for cancelling 4th normal attack as well as gaining Sigils to increase energy recharge, while hold is better against groups and for quick energy gain by consuming Sigils once it’s stacked. More explanation about tap E vs. hold E can be found in the [mechanics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iXrwYLstfwGA98YXDH7X8MO1F7PMjpKldLmRiRST6Xk/edit#bookmark=id.ndhm9yp1k6l3) section.
* Note: Physical Razor maximizes DPS by only using E for recharging his Burst, as it lowers the overall DPS of his Normal Attack combos.

### **Elemental Burst \(Q\): Lightning Fang**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8Xrx3qGdGUaH0BFbj1yuAOeKe1W_vCCeR0a1r1mhx3KfvICRFETExIRuIhIcxO-fkvHVfzIKOZY4SroUzvWAS0oq7H9omyYqh2Fz9if6k-DfoGfmtO42ybhPV-AHB0EO-I8WWHHj)

Razor summons his trusty soul companion The Wolf Within, dealing AoE Electro damage upon cast and absorbing all active Sigils for 5 energy each. For its 15s duration, The Wolf Within increases Razor’s AA speed by 26%-40% and deals Electro damage alongside each attack, based on a percentage of the scaling on each of Razor’s normal attacks. Razor also gains 80% Electro RES bonus, immunity against Electro-Charged, and resistance to interruption, but cannot use his charged attack. 20s cooldown, 80 energy cost.

* During Burst, Razor’s hold E does not cause a minor self-knockback unlike out of Burst.
* Swapping out of Razor’s Burst refunds a portion of energy based on the remaining duration, up to 10 energy max. 
* Soul companion bonus Electro damage is not affected by Gladiators, Martial Artist, and Superconduct. It is affected by ATK% and Electro DMG%.
* Razor’s Burst does not count as Electro infusion, meaning Razor fully benefits from his physical damage modifiers while gaining easy access to reactions during his ult alongside supports such as Xingqiu \(Electro-Charged\) or Kaeya \(Superconduct\).

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/s0xPfkA8I7qbeTY49Lyfc4RjpkqV21UWZj1u1IcUouEygQghVH2P6-b47y38j5q61Q7Gp0KwPp_88HWZla_iTC_Cbrp0hMdj5ajRO8ELiKfh-KGZIPoWZg1wQ3RUSbM81slJ_3vP)

### **Passive 1 \(A1\): Awakening**

Reduces the cooldown of Razor’s E by 18%. Additionally, triggering Razor’s Burst now resets the cooldown of his E.

* Effectively renders the cooldown of tap E to 4.92s and hold E to 8.2s.
* A very useful passive as it allows Razor to generate particles quickly to fuel his burst. In addition, if C4 is unlocked, a E \(tap\) &gt; Q &gt; E \(hold\) reset will shred the enemy’s defense making hold E do more damage.

### **Passive 2 \(A4\): Hunger**

Razor now has an additional 30% ER when under 50% Energy. 

* Allows Razor to get his Burst up quicker when coupled with his Sigil generation. Despite Razor’s Burst disabling his skill particle generation, he will gain additional ER from external sources \(e.g. enemy threshold particles, support skill particles\). It is also possible to stack 3 Sigils with Razor’s tap E during Razor’s Burst and after exiting Burst, hold E to consume all Sigils to quickly regain 15 energy.

### **Passive 3: Wolvensprint**

Stamina consumption while sprinting is decreased by 20% partywide, non-stackable. 

* Razor has the luxury of being one of the only characters with a useful combat passive. Less stamina consumption is particularly useful against domains with the condensed ice debuff, such as Forsaken Rift.

### **Skill Gauges**

| \*\*\*\* |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| E \(Tap\) |   **2U** |
| E \(Hold\) |   **2U** |
| Q \(Ult\) |   **2U \(Initial Burst DMG\) 1U \(On-Hit Electro\)** |

Explanation on [Gauge Unit Theory](https://library.keqingmains.com/mechanics/combat/elemental-reactions/elemental-gauge-theory) by KQM Theorycrafting Library

More info on various character gauges can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uiJje5yqv7v2UKrWoBAgBMrHrrNemtkooo8JqAGJpP8/edit#gid=0).

Razor’s skill applies 2U, meaning it has a 12.0s duration and decays at 1U per 6.0s. This means that you can trigger 2 reactions with the Electro aura from Razor’s skill as long as you cast two more skills within 6s, with the first skill being 1U \(so Razor’s 2U Electro aura can persist\).

#### **Case study: when using Razor with Kaeya and Xingqiu, what order of skill usage will result in the most optimal reactions?**

_Scenario 1: Razor E \(2U\) &gt; Kaeya E \(2U\) &gt; Xingqiu E \(1U initial skill dmg\)_

* Kaeya’s skill will consume all of Razor’s gauge as they are both 2U, leaving no Electro to react with Xingqiu’s Hydro. This combo results in only Superconduct \(the Frozen enemy in the vid was a result of Xingqiu’s rain sword, not his E damage\).

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vb_kUh6OdPO0d3LGSmyyMdpRpZ2HQIL5VlDm_AS9XUFitmSPVvKuTFToxk3PeADjbv3vpcE5LgPqXghp6QC7fSxEZjjJXj6z23Ma6Cce5iSrG6FJduoIvOpjxIBT6iVrVCSDqSCq)

_Scenario 2: Razor E \(2U\) &gt; Xingqiu E \(1U initial skill dmg\) &gt; Kaeya E \(2U\)_

* Xingqiu’s skill will only consume 1U of Razor’s gauge, leaving Electro to react with Kaeya’s Cryo. This combo results in Electro-Charged, Superconduct and Frozen.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/513xZzcLtJ20eMJQ5Pet2SriZtrtaCYp02WZfSior4fkffslU0prqkh3pVfx-SSpINvglUjLjoPkn75YEQYn--MHJwOrt-6WLCvixI8N0XJfRfMM3IbAj0J4FNGcaUYgBR8Zg9zd)

#### We can see from this case that using Xingqiu before Kaeya is much better than the reverse, as it allows you to trigger more reactions and effectively increase your Superconduct uptime before you enter Razor’s Burst.

This means that when deciding on an optimal rotation, it may be important to check the gauges of character skills to determine which skills to use first, alongside other factors. For example, in the aforementioned scenario, using Xingqiu before Kaeya is also good for other reasons. Xingqiu’s skill has a longer cooldown than Kaeya’s, and Xingqiu’s Burst also lasts longer than Kaeya’s, meaning you should be using Kaeya right before switching to Razor. As Electro reactions are transformative not amplifying, there is less of a need to worry about weak or strong auras \(more important in determining Melt/Vaporize gauges\).
