## **1. Character Introduction**

![Source: https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/646899933969908794/](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8gvmj7WFmGLdfGSXPaXFhhroxqlikfR2vTvpV9zb28nSxPbgDaSPGeXBBlgVkbocSf3dv2LmZj7PyYLHvc43M_QcP6zd7ekp_6O8YS_W5gfy8lMMAWfmkDpvFf7c400N3iL3bHFW)

“Some say he is an orphan raised by wolves. Others say he is a wolf spirit in human form. He is most at home in the wild, fighting with claw and thunder. To this day the wolf boy can be found prowling the forest, where he and his wolf pack hunt to survive using nothing more than their animal instincts.”

Razor is a 4 star Main DPS character capable of dealing massive damage over time with his hard-hitting claymore and long-lasting ultimate ability. While he is selfish in that he prefers off-field supports and maximized field time due to the nature of his ult, his consistent damage output is among the best in the game.

**But why should I read this guide? Isn’t Razor an easy character to play?**

While at a glance his skills may look fairly straightforward, there are a lot of nuances in Razor’s kit. For example, when to tap E or hold E, what rotation to perform in different scenarios, how hitlag interacts with ult, how to maximize energy regen, and perhaps most importantly, how to make the most of other character’s abilities while piloting a selfish DPS. Knowledge and mastery of Razor’s kit and of his interactions with others will enable one to use Razor to his fullest potential at all stages of the game.

In addition, Razor’s optimal playstyle varies at different investment levels. While his ascension stat \(Phys DMG bonus\) greatly benefits his normal attacks and his Electro element makes him one of the best users of Superconduct, higher talents and constellation levels dramatically increase the potency of his Electro damage output. As a result, a maxed out Razor with sufficient support will become a powerhouse of a hybrid damage dealer with virtually no hard counters.

**So what does this guide cover?** 

This guide will help you make decisions on how to build your Razor, maximize his damage through proper usage of skills, and select the right teammates for every situation. We will mostly discuss Razor as a Physical Carry, as this is by far his most popular and accessible build and allows him to be a solid Main DPS for F2P and low-spenders. For people interested in the potential of a high investment Razor, we also discuss how to maximize his endgame damage with various teamcomp demonstrations. Testing for Hybrid and Electro Razor are still underway and more information will be added whenever appropriate.

### **Pros and Cons**

#### **Pros**

1. Fast attacks in Elemental Burst negates the claymore’s key weaknesses of being slow and allows him to apply massive hitlag, making Burst achieve close to 100% uptime when always hitting enemies \(hitlag extends effective duration of Burst\)
2. High energy recharge from passive and skill, allowing him to self-fund his Burst \(can even charge Burst out of combat by consuming Electro Sigils with hold E\)
3. Can apply On-Hit Electro in Burst for constant reactions \(e.g. Electro-Charged\)
4. Burst does not grant Electro Infusion but adds additional Electro DMG \(no hard elemental counters\) and grants high Electro RES \(80%\) making him a good counter to Electro enemies despite same element disadvantage
5. Burst grants resistance to interruption, Electro-Charged immunity \(great against Electro/Hydro slimes\) and self-cleanse which is useful against leyline disorders
6. Can hit certain aerial enemies with Hold E \(useful against Oceanid, Eye of the Storm, Ruin Hunters, Pyro/Cryo Regisvine weak points, etc.\)
7. Strong against humanoid enemies prevalent lategame \(e.g. Fatui, Electro Cicin and Pyro Agent\) due to their -20% Phys RES attribute
8. Flexible with support elements since damage isn’t reliant on Melt/Vaporize, only Superconduct which can be achieved with one Cryo character
9. Third passive grants a useful combat buff \(20% sprinting stamina reduction\)
10. Claymore can break Geo shields and Hold E is very effective against Cryo shields \(semi-effective against other elemental shields\)

#### **Cons**

1. Burst does not persist through character switches, forcing a selfish Main DPS playstyle and making him generally unsuitable for quickswap teamcomps
2. Typically requires strong off field supports to improve overall team damage
3. Reliance on Physical DMG at lower investments making him weak against Ruin Guards and high Phys RES enemies
4. Electro element has no access to amplifying reactions such as Melt and Vaporize which are available to Pyro, Cryo and Hydro DPSs
5. Overload \(Electro + Pyro\) is particularly inconvenient as it causes knockback of smaller enemies, making Pyro supports situationally unsuitable
6. Is close-ranged and must be near enemies to deal damage at all times
7. Cannot deal high burst damage without significant investment \(esp. if focusing on Phys\)
8. Does not generate particles during Burst with E as part of the selfish DPS design
9. Most power budget is in his Burst, hence is reliant on high Burst uptime which can be an issue against tanky bosses \(without Electro Resonance\)
10. Pre C4, tap E is a general DPS loss compared to AA spam but needs to be used to improve Burst uptime \(without Electro Resonance\)
